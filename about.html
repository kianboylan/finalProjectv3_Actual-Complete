              <p>Hello, and welcome to the Phisherman application. This application is my final year project as a 4th year student at the National College of Ireland.</p>
              <p>This application raises awareness around phishing as it is a big contributer to data breaches, ransomware attacks, as well as the stealing of information.</p>
              <p>This application utilizes an OpenAI API, which allows for the use of plenty of their GPT models, and this application uses GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p>
              <p>With the use of this API, there is a playground where we can edit the responses the AI can give, and in this instance, I have given the system a prompt to essentially act as a phishing detection assistant.</p>
              <p>There is also an optional piece of functionality behind it, which allows users to send their interaction logs to a MongoDB Atlas database. Please see the privacy policy for more information surrounding this.</p>
