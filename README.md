Hello, welcome to the repository for my final year project.

Couple of things I should make the viewer aware of:
1. To preserve my tokens on OpenAI API, I will be removing the API key from the uploaded file and replacing it with "OPENAI_API_KEY". Please reach out to me if you need me to send it on.
2. For this folder to run properly, the 'node_modules' folder was required but was too big to have in a git repository. If    necessary, please get in touch with me
   so I can send it on. All of the base files are here.
